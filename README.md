Taxonomy is the art of classifying things. The Taxonomy Component is here to help you classify your content.

Create as many vocabularies and terms that you want and assign them to content.

Vocabularies can be Regions, Countries, Tags, Categories.<br />
A vocabulary contains terms, each term can have one or more sub-terms.
